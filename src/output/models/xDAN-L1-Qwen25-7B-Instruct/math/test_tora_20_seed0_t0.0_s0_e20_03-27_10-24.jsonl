Let \\(BE = x\\). Since \\(AB = AE + BE\\), we have \\(AB = 5 + x\\).\n\nThe key to solving this problem is to use the fact that the triangles formed by the radii and the tangent are similar. Specifically, triangles \\(ACE\\) and \\(BDE\\) are similar because they are right triangles and the angles \\(\\angle AEC\\) and \\(\\angle BED\\) are vertical angles.\n\nThe similarity ratio of the triangles is the ratio of their corresponding sides, which is the ratio of the radii of the circles. Therefore, we have:\n\\[\n\\frac{AC}{BD} = \\frac{AE}{BE} = \\frac{3}{8}\n\\]\nSubstituting the known values, we get:\n\\[\n\\frac{5}{x} = \\frac{3}{8}\n\\]\nSolving for \\(x\\), we cross-multiply:\n\\[\n5 \\cdot 8 = 3 \\cdot x \\implies 40 = 3x \\implies x = \\frac{40}{3}\n\\]\nThus, \\(AB = 5 + \\frac{40}{3} = \\frac{15}{3} + \\frac{40}{3} = \\frac{55}{3}\\).\n\nNext, we use the formula for the length of the common internal tangent between two circles with radii \\(r_1\\) and \\(r_2\\) and distance between their centers \\(d\\):\n\\[\nCD = \\sqrt{d^2 - (r_1 + r_2)^2}\n\\]\nSubstituting \\(d = \\frac{55}{3}\\), \\(r_1 = 3\\), and \\(r_2 = 8\\), we get:\n\\[\nCD = \\sqrt{\\left(\\frac{55}{3}\\right)^2 - (3 + 8)^2} = \\sqrt{\\left(\\frac{55}{3}\\right)^2 - 11^2} = \\sqrt{\\frac{3025}{9} - 121} = \\sqrt{\\frac{3025}{9} - \\frac{1089}{9}} = \\sqrt{\\frac{1936}{9}} = \\frac{\\sqrt{1936}}{3} = \\frac{44}{3}\n\\]\nTherefore, the length of \\(CD\\) is:\n\\[\n\\boxed{\\frac{44}{3}}\n\\]"], "pred": ["\\frac{44}{3}"], "report": [null]}
