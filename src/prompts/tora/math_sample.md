Analyze the following question through sequential logical steps. When encountering steps that require calculations, data manipulation, or empirical verification, you MUST generate executable Python code to validate your reasoning. Follow these guidelines precisely:

1. Thought Process Structure:
   - For each non-trivial computational/logical step:
     a) First explain the reasoning in natural language
     b) Then create a Python code block between ```python and ``` markers
     c) Immediately after, show the code's output between ```output and ``` markers
     d) Explicitly connect the output to the next reasoning step

2. Code Requirements:
   - Implement minimal verifiable examples (MVEs) to test specific hypotheses
   - Include print statements to display critical variables
   - Handle edge cases when applicable

3. Output Interpretation:
   - Quantitatively compare code results with your initial hypothesis
   - Resolve discrepancies before proceeding
   - Use exact numerical outputs to drive conclusions

Maintain clear separation between natural language explanations, code blocks, and output blocks. Present your final answer within \\boxed{}
